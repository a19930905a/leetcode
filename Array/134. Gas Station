		leetcode : https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/


		There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

		You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

		Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

		Note:

		If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
		Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
		Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
		Example 1:

		Input: 
		gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
		cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

		Output: 3

		Example 2:

		Input: 
		gas  = [2,3,4]
		cost = [3,4,3]

		Output: -1

思路:這題要我們求給的油夠不夠從 index 開始走到最後或是繞一圈到 index-1 , 從這邊我們可以知道只要耗油量 > 給油量,那肯定是 return -1 了,然後我們可以
    透過 current 值去紀錄當前的油量是不是 < 0 ,如果是我們就更新開始點

		for(int i=0 ; i<gas.length ; i++){
			current += gas[i] - cost[i];
			total += gas[i] - cost[i];
			//更新開始點
			if(current < 0){
				start = i+1;
				current = 0;
			}
		}
		return total >= 0 ? start : -1;
