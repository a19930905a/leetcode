	You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

	Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

	Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

	Example 1:

	Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

	Output: "1A3B"

	Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
	Example 2:

	Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

	Output: "1A1B"

	Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.

思路: 這題是猜數字遊戲 , 當我們猜的數字位置相同就是 A , 有猜中數字但位置不同就是 B ,這題的思路是我們可以先創一個空間為 10 的陣列,把答案跟我們所猜的
      數字儲存在這個陣列相對應的 index 內

class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
		int[] res = new int[10];
		int count_A = 0;
		int count_B = 0;
		
		for(int i = 0 ; i<secret.length(); i++){
			char s = secret.charAt(i);
			char g = guess.charAt(i);
			
			if( s==g )
				count_A++;
			else{
				if(res[s-'0'] < 0)					//該 index 先前有被猜到過
					count_B++;
				res[s-'0']++;
				
				if(res[g-'0'] > 0)					//該 index 先前答案有出現過
					count_B++;
				res[g-'0']--;
			}
		}
		
		return count_A + "A" + count_B + "B" ;
	}
