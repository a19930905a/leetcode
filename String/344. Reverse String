		leetcode : https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
		
		Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

		Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) 
		extra memory.

		You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.



		Example 1:

		Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
		Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
		Example 2:

		Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
		Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

思路 : 這題要我們反轉整個字符串,我們可利用兩指標然後將前後 swap 並使兩指標往中間靠近即可完成反轉

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
	    int left = 0;
        int right = s.length - 1;
        while(left < right){
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            
            
            left++;
            right--;
        } 
    }
}
